## About This Project

This report series was inspired by the concept of a "vibe-coding" GeoAI assistant—analyzing and curating the core Python libraries, methodologies, and data platforms that power modern geospatial AI workflows. The goal: help professionals and enthusiasts automate complex geospatial tasks (data acquisition, processing, ML/AI integration) with intuitive, high-level tools.

GeoAI, driven by Python, is rapidly evolving. This research is designed to keep you ahead of the curve—whether you work in GIS, remote sensing, data science, or related fields.
